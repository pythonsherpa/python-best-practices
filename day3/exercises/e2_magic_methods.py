Exercise 1
Create a class "Person" which you initialize with the
person's name. Implement the __str__() method. You should be
able to use it as follows:
jessica = Person("Jessica")
print(jessica)  # prints "Person named Jessica"

Exercise 2
Use your "Person" class from the previous exercise.
Besides a person's name, add also his or her height.
Implement the comparison methods so that you can check if
one person is taller than another. Use it as follows:
jessica = Person("Jessica", 180)
scott = Person("Scott", 175)
print(jessica > scott)  # prints True
